## Phase 2: Core Game Implementation

### 2.1 Basic Game Logic
```javascript
// Core game mechanics to implement:

- Hangman drawing logic
```

### 2.2 Word Categories System
```javascript
// Categories to implement:
- Animals
- Countries
- Movies/TV Shows
- Sports
- Food
- Technology
- Science
```

### 2.3 Difficulty Levels
```javascript
// Difficulty configurations:
Easy: 8-10 wrong guesses allowed, common words
Medium: 6-7 wrong guesses allowed, moderate complexity
Hard: 4-5 wrong guesses allowed, complex words
```

## Phase 3: User Interface Development

### 3.1 Responsive Layout
- Mobile-first design approach
- CSS Grid for main layout
- Flexbox for component alignment
- Media queries for breakpoint handling

### 3.2 Interactive Components

- Game status indicators
- Score and timer displays

### 3.3 User Experience Enhancements
- Smooth transitions between game states
- Loading states and animations
- Error handling and user feedback
- Accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

## Phase 4: AI Player Implementation

### 4.1 AI Difficulty Logic
```javascript
// AI implementation strategies:
Easy AI: Random letter guessing
Medium AI: Basic frequency analysis (E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R)
Hard AI: Pattern recognition and strategic guessing
```

### 4.2 AI Decision Making
- Letter frequency analysis
- Word pattern recognition
- Vowel/consonant balancing
- Adaptive difficulty based on player performance

## Phase 5: Multiplayer Implementation

### 5.1 Supabase Integration
```javascript
// Supabase setup:
- Database table creation
- Real-time subscription setup
- Authentication configuration
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
```

### 5.2 Room Management
- Room creation and joining
- Player limit enforcement
- Private/public room options
- Room list browsing and search

### 5.3 Real-time Game Synchronization
- Game state broadcasting
- Turn management system
- Player action validation
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous actions

## Phase 6: Advanced Features

### 6.1 Score System
```javascript
// Scoring algorithm:
Base points: 100
Difficulty multiplier: Easy(1x), Medium(1.5x), Hard(2x)
Time bonus: Up to 50 extra points
Streak bonus: Consecutive wins multiplier
```

### 6.2 Achievement System
- First win achievement
- Win streak achievements
- Category specialist achievements
- Speed achievements
- Perfect games (no wrong guesses)

### 6.3 Chat System
- Real-time messaging
- Emote support
- Chat filtering
- Message history

## Phase 7: Polish and Optimization

### 7.1 Animations and Sound Effects
- Hangman drawing animations
- Letter reveal animations
- Win/loss celebration animations
- Sound effects for interactions
- Background music (optional)

### 7.2 Performance Optimization
- Code splitting implementation
- Lazy loading for assets
- Image optimization
- Bundle size reduction
- Caching strategies

### 7.3 Accessibility Improvements
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard-only navigation
- High contrast mode
- Font size adjustments

## Phase 8: Testing and Deployment

### 8.1 Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for game logic
- Integration tests for multiplayer
- E2E tests for user flows
- Performance testing
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

### 8.2 Deployment Setup
- Netlify site configuration
- Domain setup (if applicable)
- Environment variables configuration
- Supabase project setup
- CI/CD pipeline configuration

## Technical Implementation Details

### Key Dependencies
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@supabase/supabase-js": "^2.0.0",
    "uuid": "^9.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "parcel": "^2.0.0",
    "eslint": "^8.0.0",
    "prettier": "^2.0.0"
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Netlify Configuration
```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm run build"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

## Database Schema

### Tables
1. `players` - User profiles and statistics
2. `rooms` - Game room information
3. `game_sessions` - Active game data
4. `word_categories` - Word lists by category
5. `achievements` - Achievement definitions
6. `player_achievements` - Unlocked achievements

### Real-time Subscriptions
- Room updates (player joins/leaves)
- Game state changes
- Chat messages
- Score updates

## Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs must be validated and sanitized
2. **Authentication**: Secure user authentication via Supabase Auth
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for API calls
4. **Data Sanitization**: Prevent XSS attacks
5. **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing setup

## Performance Targets

1. **First Contentful Paint**: < 1.5 seconds
2. **Largest Contentful Paint**: < 2.5 seconds
3. **Time to Interactive**: < 3.5 seconds
4. **Bundle Size**: < 500KB (gzipped)
5. **Lighthouse Score**: > 90 in all categories

## Success Metrics

1. **User Engagement**: Average session duration > 5 minutes
2. **Game Completion**: > 70% of games completed
3. **Multiplayer Adoption**: > 30% of players try multiplayer
4. **Return Rate**: > 40% of users return within 7 days
5. **Performance**: < 2% error rate in production
